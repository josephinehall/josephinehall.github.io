# A New Ruby Toolbox at Kiwi Ruby 2017

Hello Kiwi Ruby! Thanks for listening to me talk about our new tools for Ruby web app development <3 Want to learn more? Here are some resources to get you started.

## Slides

## Resources

* [dry-rb documentation](http://dry-rb.org/)
* [dry-rb on GitHub](https://github.com/dry-rb)
* [rom-rb documentation](http://rom-rb.org/)

## Open source examples

Check out dry-rb/dry-web-blog for our work-in-progress example app using the dry-rb gems. The team is developing this gradually, pull request by pull request, so watch the repository and you’ll be able to follow along and even chime in if you have questions or thoughts.

For a slightly more developed app, you can also check out icelab/berg, which is the code behind the Icelab company website. This one’s a little bit stale now, but it should hopefully give you some ideas about how everything fits together.

## Further reading

Tim (from Icelab) started a small blog series last year about “next-generation” Ruby apps, which explored how he started and explains in more detail some of the principles covered in the talk.

My past and future Ruby
Inactive records: the value objects your app deserves
Functional command objects in Ruby
Effective Ruby dependency injection at scale
Better code with an inversion of control container
A change-positive Ruby web application architecture
Put HTTP in its place with Roda
A conversational introduction to rom-rb
Conversational rom-rb, part 2: types, associations, and update commands
There are also others in the community who’ve been thinking and blogging about a functional approach to Ruby. A couple of good recent posts:

The Pure Function As An Object (PFAAO) Pattern, Tom Dalling
Refactoring From Inheritance To Composition To Data, Tom Dalling
Embracing Functional Programming in Ruby, Kelly Sutton
